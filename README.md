# AsciiArtCreator
A simple client side application for creating and playing ascii art animations in the browser 
written in JavaScript.

It has a few basic tools:
* drawing tool that lets you draw with the chosen character and forground and background colors.
* move tool that lets you move individual characters around
* erase tool that lets you erase individual characters
* flood fill tool that lets you fill in shapes with a chosen character and colors
* text tool that lets you add a line of text to the drawing

## Requirements
A recent version of your browser with support for HTML5 and enabled JavaScript.

## How to use it?
After drawing your frame click the `Next Frame` button and draw your next frame. When you are done 
with your frames click `Play` to see your animation in action.

## TODOS
The app needs:
- [] a lot of UI/UX polish
- [] a way for the user to save his/her work and load it later
- [] more tools
- [] layers functionality(like in Photoshop)
- [] compatibility with other similar tools
- [] a better way of storing and playing the animations
